          <p><a href="index.html"><< Back</a></p>
          <p>Not a single piece of media I have consumed in my life has had such an impact, a ripple effect, on my future trajectory than the movie Hackers.</p>

          <p>Featuring a much lesser well known Angelina Jolie, Johnny Lee Miller, and Matthew Lillard, it was by all accounts a critical failure earning only 8.5m on a 60m budget.</p>
          
          <p>I have lost count of the number of times I have watched this movie, sometimes on repeat for days while coding in the background. Last time I had a rough idea, it was well over 800 and that was around when Peyton was born.</p>
          
          <p>I was nine or ten when it came out, and I already had shown some interest in figuring out how things work but this 1995 movie solidified huge aspects of my future and still does to this day.</p>
          
          <p>I could probably quote the entire movie off the top of my head, line by line... as a few named individuals can attest to (and join in on).</p>
          
          <p>Hack the planet.</p>
